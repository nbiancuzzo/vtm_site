# Vertical Tank Management
Beginner Assignment for using Flask

## General Information
The purpose of this assignment was to get a beginners feel for using Flask. During this assignment, we needed to use HTML and CSS to design a home, about and an estimate page. The home and about page currently has lorem ipsum, while the estimate page calculates a quote for a painting job given the radius and height of a given tank that is inputted by the user.

## Technologies Used
HTML, CSS, GitHub, Microsoft Azure, Visual Studio Code, Python, Flask

## Notable Categories within Website
Home, About, Estimate

## Acknowledgements
A special thanks to Mike Colbert who taught me these skills in Digital Product Management (BAIS:3300 at the University of Iowa).

## Room for Improvement
Some room for improvement would be providing a more effective way to use CSS especially on the links for the various pages. They are certainly harder to see. Another place that I could improve is finding a way to have the user's cursor start in the tank radius box which currently sits above the tank height box. There could also be some additional padding for the submit button so it is not sitting immediately below the input boxes.
